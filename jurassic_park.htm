<li><b>The Inside Scoop:</b> "I found this book interesting from the beginning.  The action starts off slow but picks up at the end.  It brings up front some important issues.  Should we reintroduce species that have been extinct? Just because we can do something, should we?"- <i>Mr. Rieschick</i></li>
<li><b>The Inside Scoop:</b> "A great book.  To me, it's as good as the movie.  The Lost World book is even better than the movie."- <i>Mr. O'Halloran</i></li>
