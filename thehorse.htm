<p class="author"><em>C.S. Louis(1982)</em></p>
<p class="text"> Shasta is the son of Arsheesh, a Calormene fisherman. One night a visitor comes to their house. When Shasta overhears the guest and his father talking, he gets an idea. He talks to the stranger's horse and finds that it can talk. In an attempt to avoid becoming the guest's slave, Shasta and Bree (the horse) take off. They plan to go to Narnia, a country where everyone is free. While they are trying to get to Narnia, they face lions, angry mobs, and soldiers. When Shasta and Bree are in Tashbaan, one of the major cities in the country of Calormene, they become separated. Once Shasta is mistaken for someone else, his adventure changes. This is the fourth book in the Chronicles of Narnia series. </p>
<p class="text">Recommendations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;This is a great book for anyone who loves adventure.  There are a few twists in the story, but the author never lets you lose interest.&quot; -<i>Caroline Trausch</i></li>
