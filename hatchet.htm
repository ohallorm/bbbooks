<p class="text">Synopsis: A young boy, Brian Robeson, is going to his dad's for summer.  His parents had gotten divorced earlier in his life.  His dad lives a long way away so he has to take a plane, a Cessna 406 bushplane, to get there.  Something happens to the pilot shortly after they left to his dad's.  Brian has to land the plane somewhere in a big forest and figure out where he is and find a way to get back to the city.  All he has to survive is a hatchet.</p>
<p class="text">Recommendations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This is a very good book about the outdoors.  Anyone will enjoy this book if they take the time to read it.  The cover may look like it could be a little creepy, but like they say, &quot;Don't judge a book by its cover&quot;!</i> </li>
