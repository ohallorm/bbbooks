<p class="author"><em>Laurie Halse Anderson (1999)</em></p>
<p class="text">Synopsis: <b> </b> A few weeks before her freshman year in high school, Melinda Sordino and her group of friends are excited that they were invited to a &quot;high school&quot; party. During the party, Melinda becomes drunk and meets a senior, Andy Evans. Before she knows it, Melinda is raped by Andy. Melinda calls 911 and police soon arrive at the party. Meanwhile, she walks miles home to an empty house. Throughout her school year, she deals with keeping it a secret and being mistreated by what used to be her friends. Melinda, formerly a B student, beings to sink in her school work to D's and F's, except for one class. Her art class with Mr. Freeman is an A+. Through that class she discovers meaning and gains the confidence to speak out against what happened to her. </p>
<p class="text">Recommendations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;This book is so amazingly realistic. It pulls you in, as if you were Melinda and you were going through everything she is. It's one of the most amazing books I've ever read, and it really helps you understand the minds of rape and other assault victims. It's definitely a good read.&quot; - <i>Jenna Yocum</i> </li>
