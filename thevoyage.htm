<p class="author"><em>C. S. Lewis (1980)</em></p>
<p class="text"> This story takes place after King Caspian defeats his malicious uncle Miraz. Caspian is trying to look for the seven lords that were all appointed when his father was king. Caspian built the <i>Dawn Treader</i> to set sail and find the seven lords that Miraz banished. While he and his men are sailing the sea, the two younger Pevensie children, Edmund and Lucy, along with their cousin, Eustace, return to Narnia. In Narnia, they have several adventures, including being captured, meeting invisible people, and finding the end of the world. This is the third book in the Chronicles of Narnia series. </p>
<p class="text">Recommendations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;Even if you don't like stories about sea adventures, you will like this one!  This book has just about as many land adventures in it as it does sea adventures.  This is a very good book.&quot; -<i> Caroline Trausch</i></li>
