<p class="author"><em><b> </b>Simone Elkeles(2010)</em></p>
<p class="text">Synopsis: Carlos Fuentes doesn't want any part of the life his older brother, Alex, has laid out for him in Boulder, Colorado. Unfortunately, he ties to a Mexican gang, which is hard to get out of. When Alex arranges for Carlos to live with his former professor and his family to keep him from being sent to jail, Carlos feels completely out of place. He's even more thrown by his strong feelings for the professor's daughter, Kiara, who is nothing like the girls he's usually drawn to. But Carlos and Kiara soon discover that in matters of the heart, the rules of attraction overpower the social differences that conspire to keep them apart. </p>
<p class="text">Recommendations:&quot;It's a good love story for people who like to read about two different people who find love. It's a book following the book called &quot;Perfect Chemistry&quot;. You donâ€™t need to have read Perfect Chemistry prior to reading Rules of Attraction, but it helps you to better understand his relationship with his brother.&quot; - <i>Jenny Monn-Iversen</i></p>
